This is a simple application that counts down for different amounts of time
For the longer time segments, I will be studying
For the shorter ones, I will be breaking.

I would like to build this into a web app in the future, where you can have an account
that logs how long you've sudied for each day/week and what you've spent it on!

In the meantime, I will use this whilst studying ~30hrs each week on coding
