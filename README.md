# Python-Projects
 Here I am taking on more and more advanced Python projects to hone my skills. I will be creating repositories in the future for ML and DS projects, which will also be in Python!
 
 At the top of each Notebook, I'll have a description of what the script is supposed to do. Feel free to suggests improvement to my code!
